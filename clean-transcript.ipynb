      "Archived Recording [GUNSHOT] Wesley Morris To me, it’s like when the dog dies, a part of John Wick is dead too.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the part of him, the puppy that we associate — the cuddly internet creature that we associate Keanu Reeves with, if you’re so inclined to think of Keanu Reeves as a cute object — the thing that’s thrilling about John Wick is he is leaving the puppy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Y’all killed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He’s dead.\n",

      "Alex Pappademas\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, I think that that’s why “John Wick” works, because there’s a sense of him, Keanu, as a tragic figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "But you know him as someone who has grown up without his father in the picture.\n",
      "\n",
      "He loses River Phoenix shortly after “Private Idaho,” dies of a drug overdose.\n",

      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alex Pappademas\n",

      "\n",
      "Wesley Morris\n",
      "\n",
      "But it also makes him meme-able in some way too, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "We just make these presumptions about who he is and how he’s feeling based on what little of him we see off-screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alex Pappademas Yeah, the meme that really connects and turns him into this internet iconic figure is a picture of him sitting on a park bench looking sad.\n",
      "\n",
      "And they put him in all these situations, and it’s like, he’s sitting next to Kanye, or he’s sitting next to a dolphin, or whatever it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "But everyone assumes that that’s a picture of him thinking about his whole entire life and thinking about every bad thing that’s ever happened to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what happens is that everyone falls back in love with him as someone who has been stoically enduring sadness and continues to be pure of heart, despite all of this evidence that the world is a bleak and terrible place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wesley Morris I just feel like of all the movie stars we have had, he’s the only one I can think of who inspires this kind of wish fulfillment.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is not willing to put himself in the machine, and so as a result, in our own somewhat violently benign way, think that it’s our job to give him a star narrative.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I wonder if it cost him something.\n",

      "Yeah,\n",
      "\n",
      "but it’s interesting to think about it, if it’s cost him something.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because we create all these memes about him as a culture, and that allows him to live in the Twitter world, and in the Instagram world, and in those things without him having to do anything.\n",
